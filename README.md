# Adventure Game
Created by Tyler Cooper.<br/>
This project is inspired by the Atari game Adventure.<br/>
# Instructions
The goal of the game is to get your player to the end castle. To do so, you must first aquire the key!<br/>
The key is the small purple square and the end castle is the large purple square.</br>
Use the arrow keys to guide your player to the end castle!<br/>
Black rectangles are doors.</br>
You are scored based on the amount of time that it takes you to get to the end castle. The faster you complete the game, the higher your score will be!<br/>
# Bugs
1. For some reason, I couldn't get collision detection working for the castle if you don't have the key in your inventory.</br>
# Future Functionality
1. The finished game to have around 10 rooms.<br/>
2. I want to add "monsters" that if you hit them, the game ends.<br/>
3. Along with the monsters, I want some to not only move up, down, left, and right but chase the player.<br/>
4. Eventually, there will be multiple keys needed to access different areas. Each area would be required to visit in order to get to the end castle.</br>
5. The original game was limited to using basic components to build out the game but I want to have the final version to use sprites for the characters, keys, castles, etc.</br>
6. In the finished game, you will be able to move the player diagonally by pressing 2 arrows simultaneously.</br>
